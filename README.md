There are some wonderful tools for flash game developer like FTE text field, General Object Pool, Quad Search Tree etc.

These tools will help you work more efficient. Tell me if you have any ideals and suggestions.

<b>Quad Search Tree:<br /></b>
   A quick search algorithm which could help you find roles in the map in arpg games.
   The demo QuadDemo make 1000 moving roles in the screen, and hit test them every frame. You know what these search less than 1ms in my pc.
   
<b>General Object Pool:<br /></b>
  Object pool is so useful in high performance game, beacuse it can reduce gc's work greately. I designed a object pool tool which can be used in any environment.
   
<b>FTE Text Field:<br /></b>
  Fte is an low text render engine, It's more faster than TextField, besides just spend half memory. It's cool right?
