Here are some wonderful codes for flash game developer include FTE Text Render, General Object Pool, Quad Search Tree etc.

All of these can help your game work more efficient. Please do not hesitate to speak to me if you have any ideals and suggestions.

<b>Quad Search Tree:<br /></b>
   A quick search algorithm which could help you find roles in the map at arpg games.
   The demo QuadDemo make 1000 moving roles in the screen, and hit test them every frame. As you can see, each search less than 1ms in my pc.
   
<b>General Object Pool:<br /></b>
  Object pool is very useful in high performance game due to reduce gc's work greatly. Moreover We designed an object pool tool which can be used in any environment.
   
<b>FTE Text Field:<br /></b>
  Fte is a low text render engine and it is faster than TextField. Furthermore Fte just spend half memory. It is awesome, isn't it?

<b>Polish Expression:<br /></b>
  Unlike javascript and php, as3 can not calculate dynamic expression at run time. So we implement Polish Expression to deal with it. As a result, you can storage any expression like "hurt*3+atk-10" in the database, and get value when you need it at any time.
  
<b>Data Binding:<br /></b>
  Unfortunately, the air sdk do not support data binding which is very convenient to use in many occasions. And then we implement an binding system instead of flex's binding. Besides, this binding system is efficient beacuse we do not use event here.
